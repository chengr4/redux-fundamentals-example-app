# Redux Fundamentals Tutorial Example

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Notes

Note that each of reducers in `feature` folder is managing its own part of the **global** state. The state parameter is different for every reducer, and corresponds to the part of the state it manages.

The Redux core library includes a utility called `combineReducers`.
We can replace our hand-written `rootReducer` with a shorter one generated by `combineReducers`:

```javascript
import { combineReducers } from 'redux'

import todosReducer from './features/todos/todosSlice'
import filtersReducer from './features/filters/filtersSlice'

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  // Define a top-level state field named `todos`, handled by `todosReducer`
  todos: todosReducer,
  filters: filtersReducer
})

export default rootReducer
```

> **Remember, the `key` names you give to `combineReducers` decides what the key names of your state object will be!**

### How to solve unnecessary re-render?

1. [React.memo](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactmemo)
2. Another option is e.g. to have the `<TodoList>` component only read an array of todo IDs from the store, and pass those IDs as props to the child `<TodoListItem>` components. Then, each `<TodoListItem>` can use that ID to find the right todo object it needs + `shallowEqual` used to check if the items inside the array ate still the same

  ```javascript
  import React from 'react'
  import { useSelector, shallowEqual } from 'react-redux'
  import TodoListItem from './TodoListItem'

  const selectTodoIds = state => state.todos.map(todo => todo.id)

  const TodoList = () => {
  const todoIds = useSelector(selectTodoIds, shallowEqual);

  const renderedListItems = todoIds.map(todoId => {
    return <TodoListItem key={todoId} id={todoId} />
  })

  return <ul className="todo-list">{renderedListItems}</ul>
  }
  ```
  
3. [A "memoized selector"](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-7-standard-patterns)

### Redux Middleware

Redux middleware are written as a series of three nested functions:

```javascript
// Middleware written as ES5 functions

// Outer function:
function exampleMiddleware(storeAPI) {
  return function wrapDispatch(next) {
    return function handleAction(action) {
      // Do anything here: pass the action onwards with next(action),
      // or restart the pipeline with storeAPI.dispatch(action)
      // Can also use storeAPI.getState() here

      return next(action)
    }
  }
}
```

+ `exampleMiddleware` (only called once): The outer function is actually the "middleware" itself. It will be called by `applyMiddleware`, and receives a `storeAPI` object.

> `storeAPI` containing the store's `dispatch` and `getState` functions, that are the same `dispatch` and `getState` functions that are actually part of the store.

+ `wrapDispatch` (only called once): The middle function receives a function called `next` as its argument, which is actually the next middleware in the pipeline. If this middleware is the last one in the sequence, then `next` is actually the original `store.dispatch` function instead. Calling `next(action)` passes the middleware to the next middleware in the pipeline.
+ `handleAction`: Finally, the inner function receives the current `action` as its argument, and will be called every time an `action` is dispatched.

### Standard Redux Patterns

1. **Action Creators**: In practice, we don't actually write **action objects** inline when we dispatch them. Instead, we use "action creator", which creates and returns an action object.

> Action creators have two primary purposes:
> They prepare and format the contents of action objects
> They encapsulate any additional work needed whenever we create those actions

2. **Memoized Selectors**: `Memoized selector` functions are selectors that save the most recent result value, and if you call them multiple times with the same inputs, will return the same result value. If you call them with different inputs than last time, they will recalculate a new result value, cache it, and return the new result.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
